Make corner configurable from synthesis flow
Comment different memory data types

// TODO
Add synchronization to reset
Add clock gating (?)
Check synchronizers
Add clock gating directives to syntehsis flow
Add rtc constraint file
Add rtc pad
Look into periphery cdc, how SPI goes to core clock
Look into directive files of CVA6 and other IP
Double check load, transitiona nd uncertainty on timing
Share jitter value of the PLL
Constraint analog to digital interface - set isolation cells and synchronizers as don't touch
Provide the id pattern for isolation cells and synchronizer
